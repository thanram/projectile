2) [5-pts] In the context of Question 1, how should the trajectory produced by the Verlet
algorithm differ from the Euler integrator we used in the livecode?

Since we are modeling a particle moving in 3 dimensions in the varlet equation compared to in 2 dimensions with the euler integrator, the trajectory will be a spiral instead of a 2 dimensional arc.





3. [5-pts] In livecode-projectile.hpp, we defined a type-constructor called VecR2<typename>
along with operators for addition and scalar multiplication. Does the VecR2<int> type constitute
a vector space? If yes, prove it. If not, explain why not.
 the vecr2<int> type does constitute a vector space as it
